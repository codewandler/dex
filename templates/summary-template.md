## Story Selection Guidelines

When selecting the top 8-10 stories, prioritize:

1. **New Features** - Major new functionality added
2. **Performance Improvements** - Optimizations, query fixes, caching
3. **Infrastructure Changes** - Database migrations, cluster updates, terraform changes
4. **Breaking Changes** - API changes, major version bumps
5. **Security Updates** - Carrier whitelisting, auth changes
6. **Release Milestones** - Significant version releases
7. **New Tools/Projects** - CLI tools, libraries, new repos
8. **Bug Fixes** - Only if significant or customer-impacting

## Formatting Rules

### Story Title
- Keep concise (5-8 words)
- Include ticket ID if applicable: "ACD v2 Implementation (DEV-381)"
- Use action verbs: "Add", "Fix", "Upgrade", "Migrate"

### Contributors
- List primary contributors (max 3-4 names)
- Use first name + last name for clarity

### Description
- 2-3 sentences max
- Focus on WHAT changed and WHY it matters
- Include technical details sparingly

### Key MRs
- List 2-4 most important merge requests
- Format: `!123, !124, !125`
